The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes unexpected results occur if you have spaces in your calculation. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works perfectly, but `width: calc( 100% - 20px );` will likely fail. Always remove unnecessary spaces within the parentheses.
